Welcome to **PokeOps**, where **doing DevOps gets you Pok√©mon cards**.

This GitHub Action mints a **unique trading card** each time a user closes an issue marked as **[TASK COMPLETED]** in a project repo.  
Cards are added to a live **Pok√©mon Binder** webpage hosted via GitHub Pages.

> DevOps meets nostalgia. Who says CI/CD can't be fun?

## üöÄ How it Works

1. A user creates an issue with their task.
2. They close it using the title prefix: **`[TASK COMPLETED]`**
3. This triggers the GitHub Action:
   - Mints a unique Pok√©mon card via the backend API
   - Injects the card into the `docs/index.html` binder
   - Commits the update and pushes to GitHub Pages
   - Comments on the issue to confirm

You earn a new Pok√©mon card every time you complete a task.  
Your binder grows. Your DevOps karma ascends.
